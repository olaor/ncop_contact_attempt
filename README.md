# Hello ncop!

It seems that you haven't really used you github account the last five years. Do you think there is a possibility for me to take over the account or that you could delete or rename it so I could create a new account named ncop?

We use this name as an internal name for our hosting structure so it would be cool to have the ncop name on github as well :)

You can contact me on ola-github_ncop [at] ormset [dot] no .

Hope to get in touch with you!
